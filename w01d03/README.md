### Review primitive types
* string
* number
* null
* boolean
* undefined
* Symbol
* bigint

* directly stored in memory
* value cannot be changed after it is set

const age = 42;


### Rules of Thumb
* if you know the name of the key/property, use dot syntax
* if the key/property is dynamic (stored in a variable), use square brackets


* object
* array
* functions
