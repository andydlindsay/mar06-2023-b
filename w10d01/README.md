# W10D01 - Rails Review

### To Do
- [x] "Rails Week" Conversation
- [x] MVC Review
- [x] Quickly build simple Rails app
- [x] Nested Resources
- [x] Returning JSON

### Rails Week Convo
* too much magic for me, useful for simpler apps
* magic makes it hard to follow sometimes
* Rails wasn't explicit enough
* waaay too many files and folders
* don't like the ruby syntax
* implicit return in ruby is cool
* overwhelming at first (but can get used to it)
* auto file creation
* loved the hungarian notation ('!' and '?')
* singular vs plural
* proper capitalization
* rails passes data from model to view (MVC)

### MVC
* Model - responsible for data
* View - template, helper functions
* Controller - brains of the operation
